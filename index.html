    <h1>Welcome to the webpage for the Shopper App, where shopping is made ethical!</h1>
    <h3>The app and website are still under construction, but we thought we could give you an overview of what to expect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>See how ethical a product is when you scan its QR code.</li>
        <li>See any relevant news headlines associated with the ethicality of the product</li>
        <li>Shop for alternative ethical products on our app</li>
        <li>Submit product entries for us to review</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How the ethical ranking works:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ranking is broken down into 4 components: <b>Environmental impact, working conditions, complicity in corruption, and complicity in genocide. </b> </li>
        <li>Rankings sourced from reputable sources, like the <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/"> Ethical Consumer</a>, <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/ "> The Business and Human Rights Resource Center </a>, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/"> Amnesty International </a> to name a few. A more comprehensive list will be released soon. </li>
    </ul>
